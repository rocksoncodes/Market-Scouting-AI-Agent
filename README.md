# Market Scout ‚Äì The AI Agent That Finds Market Problems for You
#### For `Entrepreneurs & Developers` </br>

If you‚Äôve ever spent hours scrolling through forums, hoping to find a real problem worth solving you know how exhausting it feels.

That‚Äôs why I built Market Scout: an AI-powered agent that does the research for you. It scans Reddit communities, finds pain points people are actually talking about and uses Gemini AI to validate whether those problems are worth your time.

Instead of wasting hours on research, you can focus on what you do best: building solutions people love.



## 1. How Market Scout Works (Overview)

Imagine this:</br>

You push your code to GitHub ‚Üí Market Scout runs automatically ‚Üí Within minutes, your Notion updates with 10 real-world validated problems.</br>

That‚Äôs hours of manual research done while you work on something else or even sleep.</br>

This repository contains the initial project setup; more updates and implementations will be added throughout development.

## 2. Current Features

- Reddit Integration: OAuth-based Reddit API connection
- AI-Powered Analysis: Gemini API integration for problem validation
- Structured Logging: Comprehensive logging system
- Modular Architecture: 
  - agents/: AI agent logic and coordination
  - services/: Core business logic and API integrations
  - utils/: Shared utilities and helper functions

## 3. Quick Start

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/Market-Scouting-AI-Agent.git
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set environment variables
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Configure your .env file with:
```bash
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID       # Your Reddit API client ID
REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET   # Your Reddit API secret key
REDDIT_USER_AGENT     # Your Reddit API user agent
GEMINI_API_KEY        # Your Google Gemini API key
```

5. Run the scout agent
```bash
python main.py
```

## 4. Configuration

```bash
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID       # Reddit API client ID
REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET   # Reddit API secret
REDDIT_USER_AGENT      # Reddit API user agent
NOTION_API_KEY         # Notion integration key
NOTION_DB_ID           # Notion database ID
GEMINI_API_KEY         # Gemini LLM API key

(These will be used as features are implemented.)
```
