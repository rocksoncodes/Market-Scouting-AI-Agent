# Market Scouting AI Agent
#### `For Entrepreneurs & Developers` </br>
Automatically discovers market problems so you can focus on building solutions instead of hunting for ideas.


## 1. How Market Scout Works (Overview)

Entrepreneurs and developers spend hours manually searching forums and communities, trying to find problems worth solving.
Because this process takes so much time, I'm building Market Scout to automatically discover, filter, and structure market problems into actionable project briefs.

This way, users can focus on building solutions instead of hunting for ideas, saving time and increasing productivity.
This repository contains the initial project setup; more updates and implementations will be added throughout development.

## 2. Planned Features

- Reddit Scraper: Collects relevant data efficiently

- Problem Processor: Converts raw posts into structured problem briefs

- Notion Reporter: Organizes findings in Notion databases

- Feedback Loop: Allows iterative improvements based on user input
```bash
Note: (Features will be implemented incrementally through development sprints.)
```

## 3. Quick Start
